  ## Description

  For challenge 12 `Employee Tracker` I created an application that allows you to keep track of employee's in different departments with different roles. You can view the employee's id, name, title, which department they are in, their salary, and who their manager is. You can also view just the department and the department's id, or just the role with the role's id, the title, what the salary for that position is, and which department that role is in. With this application you can also create new departments, roles, and add new employee's. 

  While creating this application I struggled with joining the tables together and how to print them nicely with `console.table` within the `index.js` file but eventually I was able to figure out how to do it with the help of google, previous activities, and previous Zoom recordings. It also took me a long time to understand how to add multiple answers to a table at once with variables but I was also able to figure it out.
